HARDWARE

The most important hardware components on the S1 prototype 1 hardware are:
 - an AVR ATXmega32E5 microcontroller, dedicated to flight control tasks ("flight controller")
 - a CSR1010 bluetooth microcontroller, dedicated to bluetooth communication ("baseband processor")
 - an InvenSense MPU6050 inertial sensor (connected to the flight controller)
 - 4 MOSFETs used to control the motors (connected to the flight controller)

The two microcontrollers are connected through an I2C connection, where the baseband processor
is the master and the flight controller is the slave.




KNOWN HARDWARE ISSUES

Hardware bugs in the S1 prototype 1 hardware, to be solved in updated versions:

 - the power supply is not stable when the motors draw a lot of current (possibly solved using a large (330 ÂµF) capacitor)
 - the motor drivers require a capacitor and a resistor to protect them from high currents (else they break after some time)
 - the LEDs (and motors?) must not be connected to BAT- as this prevents the device from switching off completely
